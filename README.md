# **The Third Programmer**

An experiment in trio programming to find the best collaborative workflows for two engineers and one AI assistant.

## **The Experiment**

This repository chronicles our experiment in AI-augmented software development. Traditional **Pair Programming** has proven to be a powerful technique for delivering high-quality software. With the rise of capable AI code assistants, we are exploring how to evolve this practice into **Trio Programming**.

Our goal is to discover and document the most effective patterns, protocols, and best practices for a team of two human engineers collaborating with an AI agent as a third, active programmer.

### **Core Questions**

* How does the dynamic of pairing change with an AI in the mix?  
* What are the most effective roles for the AI (e.g., driver, navigator, observer, refactoring engine)?  
* How can we best leverage custom instructions to make the AI a more intelligent and context-aware partner?  
* What new collaborative patterns emerge from this trio?

### **Foundational Concepts**

* **Pair Programming:** Our starting point and theoretical baseline, guided by the principles outlined in Martin Fowler's article, "[On Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)".  
* **Code Katas:** We will use short, focused programming exercises from sources like [CodeKata.com](http://codekata.com/) to provide a consistent framework for our sessions.

## **The Team**

This experiment is being conducted by:

* **Nik Malykhin:** [nikmalykhin.com](https://www.nikmalykhin.com/about)  
* **Javier Lopez:** [Thoughtworks Profile](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-es/profiles/j/javier-lopez-fernandez)  
* **The Third Programmer:** GitHub Copilot

## **Environment & Technology Stack**

Our development and experimental environment consists of:

* **Language:** Core Java  
* **Testing Framework:** JUnit 5  
* **Build Automation:** Gradle  
* **Editor:** Visual Studio Code  
* **AI Assistant:** GitHub Copilot, enhanced with [**custom instructions**](https://www.nikmalykhin.com/p/can-we-make-ai-code-assistants-smarter) to provide more targeted and context-aware contributions.

## **Repository Structure**

This repository will be organized by the katas we undertake. Each kata will be in its own directory and will contain:

* The source code (/src).  
* A dedicated README.md file with our session notes, observations, and reflections on the process for that specific exercise.

We will be documenting our findings as we go, aiming to build a practical guide for other teams interested in exploring trio programming.
